This package is not a swift rewrite of Lua, it is simply a bridge for the C and Swift code to talk

The programming language you are probably using. If you don't know what swift is I question why you are here

Some Lua binding for Swift are XCode only or out of date, I have created this project because I couldn't find a single package that would work with SPM
